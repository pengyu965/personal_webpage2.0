General summury is always the <b>first</b> thing, which may consist of only two or three sentences, making clear what's this paper doing and the core problem it is going to solve!! Than, goes into a little bit detailed things like how many steps they build and each's step's <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> as well as the <b>relationship</b> between these steps.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
When thing's going here, it's still remain on <b>general</b> level and make sure that you are really clear with these things. (Sometimes we just thought we are clear but actually not.)
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
The final step would be going to details such as equation, mathematics and so on.

<font style="color:red">Attention:</font> <b>Don't</b> directly go to the details when people are not aware of what's this paper is going to do. Equation and mathematics are important but only the <b>last thing!</b>
